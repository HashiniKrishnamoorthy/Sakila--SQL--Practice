    "## 🌳 Decision Tree Regression – Clear Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "In **decision tree regression**, the goal is to predict a **continuous numerical value** (such as sales, price, or profit).  \n",
    "Instead of fitting one global equation, a decision tree works by **dividing the feature space into regions** and making simple predictions inside each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Dividing the Feature Space into Regions\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have input features:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "X = (X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree divides the feature space into **J distinct and non-overlapping regions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_J\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points about these regions:**\n",
    "- Each region is **distinct**\n",
    "- Regions **do not overlap**\n",
    "- Every observation belongs to **exactly one region**\n",
    "\n",
    "This division is done using a sequence of **if–else splitting rules** based on feature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Prediction Inside a Region\n",
    "\n",
    "For any observation that falls into a region \\(R_j\\), the prediction is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\hat{y}_{R_j} = \\text{mean of all } y \\text{ values of training observations in } R_j\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- The model predicts a **constant value** inside each region\n",
    "- That constant value is the **average response** of the training data in that region\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 This is why decision tree regression produces **piecewise constant (step-like) predictions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Why the Mean Is Used\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is used because it **minimizes the squared error** within a region.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single region, the value that minimizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\sum (y_i - c)^2\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "c = \\text{mean}(y)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the mean is the best possible prediction for each region under squared error loss.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Objective Function (Residual Sum of Squares)\n",
    "\n",
    "The regions are chosen to minimize the **total residual sum of squares (RSS)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\sum_{i \\in R_j} (y_i - \\hat{y}_{R_j})^2\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(J\\) is the number of regions\n",
    "- \\(y_i\\) is the actual response value\n",
    "- \\(\\hat{y}_{R_j}\\) is the mean response of region \\(R_j\\)\n",

    "### 5️⃣ How the Tree Chooses Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, the tree:\n",
    "1. Tries all possible splits across all features\n",
    "2. Computes the RSS before and after each split\n",
    "3. Chooses the split that **reduces RSS the most**\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is **greedy**, meaning it selects the best split at the current step without reconsidering previous splits.\n",

    "where \\(\\hat{y}_{R_1}\\) and \\(\\hat{y}_{R_2}\\) are the mean response values in the two regions.\n",

    "### Overfitting in Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",

    "\\text{Cost}(T) = \\text{MSE}(T) + \\alpha |T|\n",
    "\\]\n",

    "- \\(T\\) is a subtree of the full tree\n",
    "- \\(|T|\\) is the number of terminal nodes\n",
